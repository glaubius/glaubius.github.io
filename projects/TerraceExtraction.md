## Terrace Extraction from DEM

**Project description:** Agricultural terraces are anthropogenic landscape features found in many parts of the world. As part of a project modeling the impact of terraces on landscape evolution, I needed the spatial location of terraces in Vernazza, Cinque Terre, Italy. I had a 1-m resolution DEM of the study area and found [instructions on how to extract terraces using ArcGIS](https://www.researchgate.net/post/How_to_detect_extract_in_GIS_field_boundaries_walls_on_the_basis_of_DEM_and_SLOPE_raster). Since I did not have access to ArcGIS, I instead extracted the terraces using open source tools, namely QGIS and a command line tool called [Centerline](https://github.com/fitodic/centerline).
